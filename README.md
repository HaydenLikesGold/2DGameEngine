2DGameEngine
============

<b>Info:</b>
Over the past year, I have developed a few different game engines using SFML, each with a specific task. One would dynamic place tiles, one would implment an event bus, and the other was focused on collision. I learned a great deal from each one, but now it is time to take the best of what each has to offer and combine them.
